# Sales-Performance-Analytics-Dashboard


This project focused on building an interactive analytics dashboard to monitor and optimize sales performance. Over 5,000 sales transactions were aggregated, cleaned, and analyzed using SQL to identify regional trends, seasonal variations, and product-level insights. The processed data was visualized through a Tableau dashboard, enabling real-time exploration of KPIs and performance metrics. By providing actionable insights, the dashboard empowered the sales team to launch targeted campaigns, resulting in a 20% improvement in campaign effectiveness. The solution streamlined reporting, enhanced decision-making, and created a scalable framework for future sales analytics
